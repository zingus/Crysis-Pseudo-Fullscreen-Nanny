# Crysis Pseudo-Fullscreen Nanny

So, after only 11 years it's been around, I eventually started playing Crysis.

And I noticed it has some fullscreen issues. (i.e. it doesn't STAY fullscreen)

So I devised an half assed workaround:

1. It removes the window decorations
2. It centers Crysis Main Window
3. It adds a black backdrop behind it
