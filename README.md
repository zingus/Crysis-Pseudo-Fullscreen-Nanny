# Crysis Pseudo-Fullscreen Nanny

So, after only 11 years it's been around, I eventually started playing Crysis.

And I noticed it has some fullscreen issues. (i.e. it doesn't STAY fullscreen)

So I devised an half assed workaround:

1. It removes the window decorations
2. It centers Crysis Main Window
3. It adds a black backdrop behind it

# Usage

* Download the very early [v0.1 executable][v0.1]

* Install it by copying it to: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

* Tell me trough the [issue tracker][issues] if and how it isn't working for you.
